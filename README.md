## Files

1. **`library.h`**: Header file that declares the structures and functions used in the program.

2. **`stack.c`**: Source code file containing the implementation of stack operations for pushing, popping, and checking emptiness. It also includes a structure to create a stack.

3. **`queue.c`**: Source code file that implements a queue using two stacks. It includes enqueue, dequeue, and isEmpty functions, as well as a structure to create a queue.

4. **`main.c`**: The main program file that demonstrates how to use the queue data structure with enqueue and dequeue operations.

## Docstrings
